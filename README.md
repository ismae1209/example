The goal of this project is ....

insert your flowchart here

It takes many steps.

	Step1:
	I have made a blast search in lisa. The script is named "runblast.sh".
	The usage is: mzhou2@lisa: bash runblast.sh

	Step2:
	copy the output to another space.
	The usage is: mzhou2@lisa: cp xxx.txt ../


You can find the example output in this github repository as: example_output.txt
